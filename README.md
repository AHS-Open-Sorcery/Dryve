# Dryve
Helps you arrange carpools

Dryve is a revolutionary carpool-arranging tool that makes getting from Point A to Point B easier and more environmentally-friendly than ever before!

##**Dryve**
_Don't be a **carfool**, use **Dryve** to carpool!_
## Inspiration

Our team carpooled to blueprint today and the challenges that arose gave us an idea. This gave us an idea to develop software to ease the pain of having to coordinate carpooling.
In addition, we were inspired by the environmental benefits and sustainability of carpooling. 

## What it does

Drivers can post trips that they are taking and share those trips with their friends who have the option of carpooling with them. The carpoolers first request to join the driver who can accept (or just not accept) the request after considering the changes to the trip it will make. The driver is able to view the route on google maps.

## How we built it

We used Flask, a python framework for web servers; Jinja 2, for 
Google Cloud Firestore
Google Maps API
Google Authentication API
jQuery
Materialize CSS
FontAwesome icons

## Challenges we ran into

We had a very short time frame and we dropped many features due to time restraints but we plan on implementing them soon on a later day.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were able to combine many of our different strengths productively as well as integrating newer technologies we were not comfortable with.

## What we learned

Google API's - maps, authentication, firestore database, App Engine
etc.

## What's next for Dryve

More features.
We were working on making an in house version of google maps that worked like an application.
We are planning on iOS dev.
